      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p> We are Team Internet Freedom (TIF) and we are the interest group that wants Congress to vote to keep net neutrality regulations. We are targeting our town, Farmington, Minnesota because it is a liberal area. First off, net neutrality regulations are important because they keep internet providers like Comcast from blocking or throttling speeds on certain websites. According to ABC news, Comcast used to do these things in 2007. Imagine having to pay extra to your internet service provider just so your Netflix is not slowed down or restricted. Furthermore, the FCC has voted to get rid of net neutrality regulations. According to The Verge, on December 14, 2017, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s wish to kill net neutrality came true. There was lots of backlash after this decision. Netflix tweeted that they are disappointed in the decision, saying, “This is the beginning of a longer legal battle. Netflix stands w/ innovators, large & small, to oppose this misguided FCC order.” But, Congress can stop this with a “Congressional Review Act” vote. So, call your representative and tell them you oppose the FCC’s decision.</p>

      <h2>Extra Information</h2>
        <p> In 2015, Obama’s FCC passed regulations protecting net neutrality. The FCC agency, located in Washington D.C., stands for Federal Communications Commision and is responsible for maintaining the radio, television, and phone industries. Net neutrality keeps internet providers from throttling speeds, and keeps them from blocking websites.<br><br>

     Comcast is an Internet service provider and is against net neutrality and wants to control what we see and do online. They had hidden fees that had no justification or documentation in 2016. In 2007, Comcast was throttling traffic, and the FCC had one more reason to make regulations protecting net neutrality.<br><br>

     In November of 2017, Donald Trump’s FCC Chairman, Ajit Pai, proposed to terminate open internet protections that keep broadband providers from blocking, slowing or interfering with internet traffic. Meaning, he seeks to hand over the responsibility for net neutrality to another federal agency. The other agency arguably has a lot less capability to protect buyers from corporate damage. <br><br>

     Ajit Pai’s proposal has created very intense online backlash. Forces could come together to mount a lawsuit, possibly resulting in months or years of further legal arguments over one of the web’s most unresolved problems. Meanwhile, telecom giants have claimed they would invest further into their networks if the U.S. government would only regulate them less.<br><br>

     On December 14, 2017, Ajit Pai got his wish to kill net neutrality. One of the reasons he did this was, “The internet wasn’t broken in 2015. We weren’t living in a digital dystopia. There was no problem to solve,” he said ignoring the fact that internet providers blocked content for many years. He wrapped up his speech with,  “Americans will still be able to access the websites they want to visit. They will still be able to enjoy the services they want to enjoy,” which is false because he just voted to remove the rules that guarantee those things.<br><br>

    If you want to do something about this, it is not too late. If you want the net to stay neutral, you should call your representative and tell them to save net neutrality. Congress will vote on whether to keep net neutrality or not, so let them know.</p>

      <h2>Why Are We Doing This?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Everyone has the right to petition the government as it says in the 1st Amendment.</li>
          <li>We also have the right to assembly according to the 1st Amendment.</li>
          <li>The 9th Amendment says we have more rights than the constitution says. Net neutrality is one of those rights.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Why Should You Do Something About It?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Be a good democrat! If you are a democrat, you shouldn’t call yourself one if you do not care about this issue.</li><br>
            <li>You do not have to be democratic either. Just because Donald Trump’s republican FCC Chairman made this happen, does not mean you can’t oppose it. </li><br>
            <li>Without net neutrality, internet providers can slow down anything from Netflix to your favorite video game.</li>
            
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps To Making Sure The Internet Stays Neutral</h2>
    <h3>1. Educate Others</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Post and share things on social media: Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, etc.</li>
          <li>Make posters</li>
          <li>Talk to your friends and family</li>
          <li>Print handouts</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>2. Contact your represenative</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Find out who your senator/represenative is</li>
        <li>Find their stance on the net neutrality issue</li>
        <li>If they do not have a stance on the issue, call them</li>
        <li>Tell them you are in favor of net neutrality</li>
      </ul>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p><strong><em>It is as simple as that. Anyone can do it. If enough people contact their represenatives that are not in favor of net neutrality, we may be able to change their stance on the issue.</em></strong></p>
